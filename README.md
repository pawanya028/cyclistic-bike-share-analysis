 # 🚴‍♂️ Cyclistic Bike-Share Rider Behavior Analysis  

### 📁 Project Overview
This project analyzes Cyclistic bike-share trip data to understand behavioral differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**.  
The insights support marketing strategy decisions to convert casual riders into long-term subscribers.

This case study follows the Google Data Analytics Capstone framework:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

---

### 🎯 Business Objective
Determine how casual users and annual members use bikes differently and recommend data-driven strategies to convert casual users into members.

---

### 📊 Key Insights

| Insight | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
Members take far more total rides | Daily commuting + consistent use  
Casual riders take much longer trips | Leisure, tourism, weekend activity  
Member rides peak on weekdays, morning/evening | Work commute schedule  
Casual riders peak on weekends | Recreational use pattern  

---

### 🧠 Key Findings Summary

- **Members = commuter behavior**  
  Short, frequent trips, strong weekday usage around 8AM & 5PM

- **Casual riders = leisure behavior**  
  Long rides & weekend peaks suggest tourism/recreation

- **Conversion opportunity**  
  casual riders already use the system, so targeted offers can convert them

## 📁 Project Overview
This data analytics case study explores **Cyclistic bike-share usage** to understand behavioral differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**.  
The objective is to develop **data-driven strategies** to convert casual riders into annual members and boost long-term revenue.

This project follows the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Framework**:  
> **Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
Identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and provide insights and recommendations that support increasing membership conversions.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

| Insight | Interpretation |
|---|---|
Members take significantly more rides | Consistent **daily commuting** usage |
Casual riders take longer trips | **Leisure / tourism** pattern |
Member rides peak weekdays | **Work commute behavior** |
Casual rides peak weekends | **Recreational behavior** |
Commute peaks at 8 AM and 5 PM | Standard **rush-hour pattern** |

---

## 🧠 Summary Conclusions
- Annual members = **regular commuters**
- Casual riders = **leisure/weekend users**
- Best opportunity = **convert high-frequency casual leisure riders**
- Market membership as **flexible + cost-saving for weekend use too**

---

## 🚀 Recommendations

| Strategy | Reason |
|---|---|
Weekend/seasonal membership options | Attract weekend leisure riders |
Loyalty or rewards program | Encourage frequent casual riders to convert |
Target ads near tourist & park zones | Reach recreational riders at ride start-points |
Emphasize membership cost savings | Long casual rides = strong value case |

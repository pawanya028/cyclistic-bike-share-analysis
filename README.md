## 📁 Project Overview
This case study explores **Cyclistic's bike-share usage data** to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use the service differently.

The objective is to identify strategies that can **convert casual riders into annual subscribers**, increasing revenue and rider retention.

This project follows the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Framework**:
> **Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
Identify behavioral differences between casual users and annual members and create **data-driven recommendations** to convert casual users into annual subscribers.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

| Insight | Interpretation |
|---|---|
Members take significantly more rides | Indicates **daily & consistent usage**
Casual riders take much longer trips | Primarily **leisure/tourism**
Members ride mostly on weekdays | **Work commute behavior**
Casual riders peak on weekends | **Recreational & tourist patterns**
Morning & evening peaks for members | **8 AM & 5 PM commute hours**

---

## 🧠 Summary Conclusions
- **Members = commuters** (short, frequent trips during weekdays)
- **Casual riders = leisure/tourism** (longer rides on weekends)
- Opportunity: **Position memberships as cost-effective for frequent leisure riders too**

---

## 🚀 Recommendations

| Strategy | Why it works |
|---|---|
Weekend/Seasonal membership plans | Targets weekend leisure riders
Ride rewards/loyalty program | Turns occasional users into routine riders
Tourist-zone marketing campaigns | Reaches casual riders where they start rides
Highlight membership savings | Casual rides are long; encourage cost-saving annual plan
